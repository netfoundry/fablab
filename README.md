# Welcome to the Fabulous Laboratory

_(This is a work-in-progress document where sections may end randomly and abrubptly. Stay tuned)_

The Fabulous Laboratory (`fablab`) is incubating an evolved set of tooling addressing operational development concerns for large-scale, distributed deployment models. These tools are being created to directly address the needs of developing, deploying, researching, and managing geo-scale [Ziti](https://ziti.dev) networks (and Ziti network applications) in development and testing environments. We also foresee these tools being useful beyond our specific purpose, and finding uses in many areas of operational development.

## "As Code" as Actual Code

A great number of "as code" tools use hobbled, miserable DSLs (or they repurpose structured markup like YAML or JSON) to express their structures. These can be useful, up until the point where you need to start remotely operating and controlling these systems with any kind of complex choreography, where these DSLs tend to break down, badly. To compensate, you might end up stringing together multiple disparate layers of tooling to assemble a [Rube Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg) contraption to meet all of your needs.

_Programmers_ solved these kinds of problems long ago with general purpose programming languages. A reasonable general purpose progamming stack, equipped with strong extension points (a "framework") is much better "glue" than trying to assemble different self-contained systems using scripts and cron jobs (even if they're disguised as microservices) to meet the entirety of your operational needs.

`fablab` is a _programming_ toolkit, implemented in `golang`, which seeks to support the creation of self-contained, concise, repeatable, expressive, workflow-laden operational tooling. We anticipate that `fablab` will have roles across the entire operational spectrum, from conception to retirement.

`fablab` is designed to support the development and exploration of programming models for geo-scale, distributed systems.

## The Components of fablab

Like many other software tools that offer multiple degrees of freedom and extensibility, `fablab` is best described as a set of orthogonal ideas, which combine to facilitate extremely powerful, extensible software concepts. In order to understand the entirety of `fablab`, you'll want to make sure you understand each of the core capabilities that it provides.

Once you've grokked those ideas, you'll begin to see how they can be combined to create extremely powerful implementations, which dovetail seamlessly into your development environment.

### The Model

All `fablab` environments are represented by a "model" (`model.Model`). The model contains all of the data structures (`model.Host`, `model.Region`, etc.), static definitions (`model.Scope`, etc.), dynamically (late) bound components, and the logic (`model.Action`, lifecycle stages (`model.InfrastructureStage`, etc.), `model.Factory`) that comprise your distributed system.

`fablab` also includes a comfortable, convenient command-line user interface for working with and manipulating instances of models. The `fablab` command-line interface is conceptually similar to tools like `docker` and `vagrant`, where you can manage and work with multiple runtime environments ("model instances") from a host (typically a developer workstation).

Conceptually, `fablab` breaks these architectural concepts into three layers: the "structural model", the "behavioral model", and the "instance model".

### The Structural Model

The structural model maintains a "digital twin" of the distributed environment as a set of data structures expressed in `golang` (JSON representations coming!). You define the structure and configuration of your distributed deployment by arranging components from the `model` package (`model.Model`, `model.Region`, `model.Host`, etc.) into a hierarchy that matches your desired environment footprint.

You can generate your `Model` statically in code, or programmatically in response to any stimulus you might want to observe. You can reconfigure the shape of your `Model` according to stimulus as well, and `fablab` will reconfigure your concrete environment to match.

Define the structural model directly. Define it programmatically by reverse engineering existing environments. Define it dynamically according to external data sources (dynamic, workload-responsive deployments?). Define it how it best way that makes sense for your domain, and allow the other parts of your deployment to develop without having to understand anything about how the underlying model structure was derived.

### The Behavioral Model

`fablab` provides a rich set of interfaces, which define the contract between the structural model, and the behaviors implemented against that model. This _separation of concerns_ is a classic solution to subdividing complexity across complicated software domains.

There are a core set of concepts support intrinsicly as part of a `fablab` behavioral model, these include:

#### Factories

`fablab` uses a collection of `model.Factory` instances, wired into your model, to contain and manage the code related to building the model itself. These modules have clear interfaces, and a specific role inside of `fablab`, focused on constructing the components of your model.

#### Lifecycle Stages

`fablab` models have a lifecycle that consists of a number "stages" that an "instance" of the model can progress through, both forward and backward. Each of the lifecycle stages focus clearly (and orthogonally) on a specific portion of the life of a model instance. `fablab` provides interfaces that define the contract that must be fulfilled by lifecycle stage bindings. See `model.InfrastructureStage`, `model.ConfigurationStage`, etc. for more details.

`fablab` currently offers 7 lifecycle stages: `Created`, `Infrastructure`, `Configuration`, `Kitting`, `Distribution`, `Activation`, `Operation`, and `Disposal`.

#### Actions

`fablab` provides a general-purpose programming facility for developing and packaging discrete functions against a model. The `model.Action` interface defines a component model for these functions. `fablab` will execute actions against models, regardless of the current lifecycle stage of the model instance.

Actions are useful for supplying your models with coherent, isolated functionality that end-users can run against their instances of your model.

### The Instance Model

`fablab` provides an instance model, which can be used to manage many instances of models, maintaining the unique operational state and data output from the model for a specific hosted environment. Users of your `fablab` model can create instances, which `fablab` will express concretely in one or many hosting environments.

The instance model includes command-line tools for managing model instances, as well as interacting with the data that goes into and out of those models from the environment.

### The Kernel

The `fablab` "kernel" includes all of the low-level components and concepts that the various behavioral model components can be constructed from.

The kernel includes primitives for remote puppetry using `ssh`, along with reliable, easy-to-use mechanisms for interacting with operating systems, whether local or remote. It can be extended to integrate with anything that can be controlled from code.
