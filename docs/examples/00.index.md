# Getting Started with the Examples

`fablab` includes several pre-built models, which we will explore in this guide.

The `zitilib/examples/tiny` model and the `zitilib/examples/smartrouting` model, both implement operational Ziti fabric overlays, perform fabric-native operational testing using the `loop2` tool, and provide data sets about mesh configuration and performance metrics.

### First, you'll need to make sure you've got all of your prerequisites configured:

1. [Prerequisites](01.prerequisites.md)

### Then, we'll take you through creating your first `fablab` model instance:

2. [Creating an Instance](02.creating.an.instance.md)

### We'll use that instance to run a workload:

3. [Operating the Instance](03.operating.the.instance.md)

### And then we'll free the resources and clean up your environment:
