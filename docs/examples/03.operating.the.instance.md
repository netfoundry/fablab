# Operating the Instance

With our instance `Activated` in the [previous step](02.creating.an.instance.md), we can run the operational workloads the model was designed to facilitate. Those operational workloads are inserted into the model as `model.OperatingStage` strategies, which are invoked when we `fablab run` the instance:

```

We'll explain `fablab` model programming in more detail in a subsequent section, but we'll use snippets of code from this model to explain what's happening. We'll specifically be looking at the code in the file:

`zitilib/models/examples/operation.go`

The code in this file implements a `model.Factory`, which is invoked by `fablab` to create the `model.OperatingStage` components that get inserted into the model, so that when `fablab run` is invoked, each of those components will be executed in order to perform the workload. Again, in this case, we're capturing metrics and mesh data, while executing a `loop2` testing scenario. `loop2` is a performance and correctness testing tool for the Ziti overlay fabric.

The main entry point into the `model.Factory` is this function:

```
func (self *operationFactory) Build(m *model.Model) error {
	...
}
```

We'll save the bits about `closer`s and `joiner`s for a more advanced discussion on asynchronicity and synchronization, but know that anything related to those concepts are used in this code to synchronize activities that happen in multiple execution threads.

The first two lines of output from our `run` include these:

```
[   0.099]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*mesh).runMesh: starting
[   0.197]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*metrics).runMetrics: starting
```

Those two lines correspond to the invocation of these two `OperatingStage` strategies:

```
m.Operation = append(m.Operation, model.OperatingBinders{
	func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage { return zitilib_5_operation.Mesh(closer) },
	func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage { return zitilib_5_operation.Metrics(closer) },
}...)
```

Those two strategies launch threads which capture Ziti mesh topology details (routers, links), and also Ziti fabric metrics from the overlay network.

With those strategies running, our operating stage then needs to invoke the `loop2` listeners, which is done using the `listeners` function:

```
func (_ *operationFactory) listeners(m *model.Model) (binders []model.OperatingBinder, err error) {
	hosts := m.GetHosts("@terminator", "@loop-listener")
	if len(hosts) < 1 {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("no '@terminator/@loop-listener' hosts in model")
	}

	for _, host := range hosts {
		boundHost := host
		binders = append(binders, func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage {
			return zitilib_5_operation.LoopListener(boundHost, nil)
		})
	}

	return binders, nil
}
```

This code iterates through the structural model, looking for host(s) that are tagged with `loop-listener` in the region(s) that are tagged with `terminator`, and then adds a `LoopListener` `OperatingStage` for each of the hosts. When `fablab run` executes the operating lifecycle stage (via `fablab run`), it will invoke the `LoopListener` for each of the hosts that were wired up from this factory:

```
[   0.868]    INFO fablab/kernel/fablib.RemoteExec: executing [54.164.129.148:22]: '/home/fedora/fablab/bin/ziti-fabric-test loop2 listener -b tcp:0.0.0.0:8171 >> /home/fedora/logs/loop2-listener-1583422217144.log 2>&1'
```

Our `tiny` model only contains a single host, so there is only a single `loop2 listener` execution on this host.

Our factory then wires up a delay of 5 seconds:

```
	m.Operation = append(m.Operation, func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage {
		return fablib_5_operation.Timer(5*time.Second, nil)
	})
```

`Timer` is part of the core `fablab` model, and is used to create `OperatingStage` delays. It's output is also in our `run`:

```
[   0.867]    INFO fablab/kernel/fablib/runlevel/5_operation.(*timer).Operate: waiting for 5s
```

If you're being observant, you'll notice that even though the listeners were wired into the operating stage before the `Timer`, the `Timer` log message appears first. This is because the `LoopListener` strategies are threaded, and start executing ever so slightly later than the `Timer`. This is part of why we need to deal with synchronization: `fablab` supports many concurrent processes that support distributed environments and workloads.

Next, the `loop2 dialers` are wired into the model:

```
dialers, dialerJoiners, err := self.dialers(m)
if err != nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("error creating dialers (%w)", err)
}
joiners = append(joiners, dialerJoiners...)
m.Operation = append(m.Operation, dialers...)
```

In this case, we're adding to a collection of `joiners`. We'll explain why shortly.

When the `run` stage executes, the output from our dialers looks like this:

```
[   6.296]    INFO fablab/kernel/fablib.RemoteExec: executing [54.164.129.148:22]: '/home/fedora/fablab/bin/ziti-fabric-test loop2 dialer /home/fedora/fablab/cfg/10-ambient.loop2.yml -e tls:54.164.129.148:7002 -s 001 >> /home/fedora/logs/loop2-dialer-1583422217144.log 2>&1'
```

The `loop2` facility uses a "scenario" definition to describe the workload that will be executed. It uses vigorous checking to make sure that every bit of data makes it across the overlay and in the correct order. We're launch a scenario file called `10-ambient.loop2.yml`. It contains this configuration:

```
# This is an example workloads definition for the loop2 tool.
#
workloads:
  - name:               chatter
    concurrency:        10
    dialer:
      txRequests:       100
      txPacing:         500
      txMaxJitter:      500
      rxTimeout:        15000
      payloadMinBytes:  4096
      payloadMaxBytes:  8192
    listener:
      txRequests:       100
      txPacing:         500
      txMaxJitter:      500
      rxTimeout:        15000
      payloadMinBytes:  4096
      payloadMaxBytes:  8192

  - name:               big
    concurrency:        1
    dialer:
      txRequests:       20
      txPacing:         1000
      txMaxJitter:      2500
      payloadMinBytes:  51200000
      payloadMaxBytes:  102400000
    listener:
      rxTimeout:        30000
```

This file describes a pair of `workloads`. The first workload is named `chatter`, and it both transmits and receives 100 random payloads with a size between 4k and 8k, across 10 clients, for a total of 2000 requests. There is also a `big` workload, which transmits 20 payloads of a much larger size.

This scenario runs for a finite amount of requests and usually finishes in about 2 minutes (on `t2.micro`). While the `loop2` scenario is executing the mesh and metrics strategies that were launched continue to receive telemetry from the overlay network. You'll see their log messages throughout the run:

```
[  15.126]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*mesh).interrogate: </=
[  15.830]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*metrics).HandleReceive: <$= [001]

[  45.830]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*metrics).HandleReceive: <$= [001]

[  75.830]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*metrics).HandleReceive: <$= [001]
```

The `</=` messages are mesh updates, and the `<$=` messages are metrics data being received from a Ziti router.

Finally, our factory wires these 3 `OperatingStage` strategies into the model:

```
m.Operation = append(m.Operation, model.OperatingBinders{
	func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage { return fablib_5_operation.Joiner(joiners) },
	func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage { return fablib_5_operation.Closer(closer) },
	func(m *model.Model) model.OperatingStage { return fablib_5_operation.Persist() },
}...)
```

The first strategy, `Joiner` uses the `joiners` list that we created when wiring in our `LoopDialer` components to wait for all of the `LoopDialer` instances to complete, which they will do when they finish the scenario or exit with an error.

_The joiner is a golang `chan`, which the `LoopDialer` `close`s when it's finished. The `Joiner` waits for all of these `chan` instances to close before proceeding._

After the run joins with the `LoopDialer`s, it then invokes the `Closer`, which is used to signal the mesh and metrics components to shut down.

And finally, the model will invoke the `Persist` strategy, which causes the runtime state of our instance to be persisted as a `fablab` "dump" (a JSON representation of the model state).

These components produce these log messages:

```
[  87.579]    INFO fablab/kernel/fablib/runlevel/5_operation.(*joiner).Operate: joined with [1] joiners
[  87.579]    INFO fablab/kernel/fablib/runlevel/5_operation.(*closer).Operate: closing
[  87.579]   ERROR ziti-foundation/channel2.(*channelImpl).rxer [ch{mesh}->u{classic}->i{LPvy}]: rx error (short read)
[  87.580]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*mesh).runMesh: exiting
[  87.580]   ERROR ziti-foundation/channel2.(*channelImpl).rxer [ch{metrics}->u{classic}->i{7n83}]: rx error (short read)
[  87.580]    INFO fablab/zitilib/runlevel/5_operation.(*metrics).runMetrics: exiting
[  87.581]    INFO fablab/kernel/fablib/runlevel/5_operation.(*persist).storeDump: dump saved to [/home/michael/.fablab/instances/first/dumps/1583422217144.json]
```

You can see the joiner and closer components executing, and then two `ERROR` messages from the channels `ch{mesh}->u{classic}->i{LPvy}` and `ch{metrics}->u{classic}->i{7n83}`. These are ignorable errors that result from the normal closure of the management channel connections used to capture mesh and metrics data.

And finally there is a mesage from the persist operation, showing the location of the stored dump. This location is inside of `~/.fablab/instances/first` (the location of the instance data for our `first` instance).

## Done?

Feel free re-execute the `fablab run` command as many times as you like. Subsequent dumps will be saved for each run. Explore the dump files (they're just JSON) and see the data set produced for each run.
